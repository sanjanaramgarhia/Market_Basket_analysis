What is Apriori Algorithm?

Apriori algorithm finds sets of items that appear together frequently, and then builds rules like If a customer buys X, they also buy Y.

It helps you find patterns, co-occurring items, and hidden relations in large datasets — mainly used in market basket analysis.

Why it is called Apriori?
Because it uses a-priori knowledge:
  If an itemset is frequent, then all its subsets must also be frequent.
  If a subset is not frequent, the larger set containing it cannot be frequent.

How it Works?
It mathematically uses support and confidence.

Support - Support tells you how frequently an item or itemset appears in the dataset.
Formula:S = Number of transactions containing A​/ Total number of transction.

Confidence - Confidence tells you how often items in B are bought when items in A are              bought.It is used for rules like:
             𝐴→𝐵
Formula: C = Support of (AUB)/ Support of A.

Lift - Lift measures how much more likely items A and B are bought together compared to        their independent probabilities.
       L = Support of (AUB)/ Support of A * Support of B

Lift > 1 → Strong positive association
Lift = 1 → No association
Lift < 1 → Negative association

* Lift tells you if items are actually related or just coincidentally purchased together.
